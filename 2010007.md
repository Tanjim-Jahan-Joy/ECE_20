## 1. Experiment No: 2

## 2. Experiment Name:

Understanding and Implementing Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:

- To explore the fundamental principles of best coding practices.
- To learn how to structure code for readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

## 4. Source Code and Description

Below is a sample Python code that demonstrates the application of best coding practices, including different naming conventions. The code calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function and is well-documented with consistent naming styles.

### Source Code

```python
# Filename: factorial_calculator.py

# PascalCase for Class Names
class FactorialCalculator:
    """
    A class to calculate the factorial of a given number using different naming conventions.
    """

    # snake_case for function and variable names
    def calculate_factorial(self, number):
        """
        Recursively calculates the factorial of a given number.

        Args:
            number (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be calculated.

        Returns:
            int: Factorial of the given number.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the input number is negative.
        """
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")

        # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        if number == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            # Recursive case: factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
            return number * self.calculate_factorial(number - 1)

    def run_calculator(self):
        """
        Main function to execute the factorial calculation.

        Prompts the user for input and calculates the factorial
        of the provided number using the calculate_factorial function.
        """
        try:
            # camelCase for variable used locally
            userInput = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

            # Calculate factorial
            result = self.calculate_factorial(userInput)

            # Display the result
            print(f"The factorial of {userInput} is: {result}")

        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# ALL_CAPS for constants
MAX_NUMBER = 1000

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator = FactorialCalculator()
    calculator.run_calculator()

```

### Description of Naming Conventions:

**PascalCase:** This style capitalizes the first letter of each word without spaces or underscores, typically used for class names. Example: FactorialCalculator.

**snake_case:** Uses lowercase letters with words separated by underscores, commonly applied to function and variable names in Python. Example: calculate_factorial, run_calculator.

**camelCase:** Starts with a lowercase letter, with each subsequent word capitalized. It’s often used for local variables or properties within a class. Example: userInput.

**ALL_CAPS:** All letters are capitalized with underscores separating words, typically reserved for constants. Example: MAX_NUMBER.

## 5. Discussion

Implementing different naming conventions based on the context of the code can enhance clarity and consistency:

**PascalCase for Classes:** Using PascalCase for class names makes it easy to identify the class in the code. It distinguishes class types from functions and variables, making the structure clearer.

**snake_case for Functions and Variables:** This is the standard convention in Python for function and variable names, which enhances readability. The consistent use of lowercase letters and underscores provides a clear separation between words, making code easier to understand.

**camelCase for Local Variables:** While less common in Python, camelCase is sometimes used for variables within a small, localized scope. This convention can help differentiate between class-level attributes (often snake_case) and local variables.

**ALL_CAPS for Constants:** Using ALL_CAPS for constants immediately indicates that the value should remain unchanged. It’s a clear visual signal that the variable holds a fixed value throughout the program.

By following these naming conventions, the code becomes more readable and maintainable, which is particularly important in collaborative environments. Consistent naming helps developers quickly understand the role of a variable or function, reducing the chances of errors and improving overall code quality. Adopting these standards is a key aspect of best coding practices, ensuring that code is clean, well-structured, and accessible to any developer who may interact with it.

## 1. Experiment No: 3

## 2. Experiment Name:

Study of Different Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:

- To grasp the purpose and application of Git commands.
- To learn how to utilize Git for version control and team collaboration.
- To explore various Git commands for managing repositories effectively.

## 4. Theory:

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code throughout software development. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without conflicting with each other's work. Essential Git concepts include repositories, commits, branches, and merges. This experiment aims to explore various Git commands, their functions, and how they facilitate effective version control.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:

   - Use `git init` to initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone an existing repository**:

   - Use `git clone` to clone a remote repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check repository status**:

   - Use `git status` to check the current status of the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Add files to the staging area**:

   - Use `git add` to add specific files or all changes to the staging area.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add filename.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit changes**:

   - Use `git commit` to save changes to the repository with a message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View commit history**:

   - Use `git log` to view the commit history.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:

   - Use `git push` to upload changes to a remote repository (like GitHub).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:

   - Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Branch management**:

   - Use `git branch` to create and list branches.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch new-feature
     git checkout new-feature
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Use `git merge` to merge changes from one branch into another.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge new-feature
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
# Check status
git status
# Add files
git add .
# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Push changes
git push origin main
# Pull updates
git pull origin main
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch
# Merge branches
git merge feature-branch
```

### Discussion:

In this experiment, we examined essential Git commands for effective code management.

**Repository Initialization:** We used git init to create a new repository and git clone to duplicate an existing one, enabling us to start a new project or collaborate on an existing codebase.

**Tracking and Staging:** The git status command allows us to review the current status of files, while git add stages modifications for the next commit, keeping our work structured and prepared for version control.

**Committing and Syncing:** We utilized git commit to save changes with a descriptive message, and git push to upload these changes to a remote repository. git pull was used to update our local version with changes from other contributors.

**Branching:** The git branch command helped manage separate development paths, and git merge was used to integrate changes from different branches.

These commands enable us to track modifications, collaborate effectively, and handle multiple versions of our code seamlessly.
